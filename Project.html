        <h1>Project - Understanding the decline in global fertility rates</h1>
        <h2> Aims of Projects</h2>
        <p> Fertility rates are very important for the stability and growth of an economy. 
            As fertility rates fall, working-age populations eventually fall as well, which can lead to labor shortages in countries where the working-age populations are in decline. 
            This is why some see the current situation of declining fertility rates as a real issue. 
            The main aims of this project are to evaluate the accuracy of some of the most commonly cited reasons behind the convergence in fertility rates and to show why there is infact differences in fertility rates amongst countries.
            <p>

        <h3> Figure 7 - Childcare Costs</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div>

        <h2> Data</h2>
        <p>I obtained data from three sources, the World Bank (Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and Money.co.uk (Figure 7) and Statistics Times (Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7). 
            The data from the World Bank was accessed through CSV files; though an API was available, the cleaning of the data would have prevented the API from requesting data. 
            Also, the demographic nature of the data reduces the benefits of an API, that would have only received new data on an annual or less basis.
            Aside from this, an advantage of data being uploaded on GitHub is that it will never go down, unlike with an API.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data for child-bearing costs was scraped from Money.co.uk with the corresponding code being accessible <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19RCEhVcSXRaVGMDBK-e7iYH6SUpRD3FX#scrollTo=b3H_54DUlxQ_"> here</a>:
            Similarly, the data that allowed the function of the legends in the figures, and the continent selection parameter in Figure 1, was scraped from Statistics Times, and that can be found <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tVVqPGxhy4DCQoCxk9NmAwivbnCbZcmo#scrollTo=ikaFyr5fNxPa"> here</a>.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            I chose to focus on fertility decline on a global scale rather than looking at specific or groups of countries, since from the charts it was clear that different continents and countries reacted to trends in different ways; as such I believed that it provided a greater narrative to tell.
        </p>

        <h2> Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>One issue that was clear was that the CSV files downloaded from the World Bank were not in a format that Vega Lite could not read, therefore, I used Google Colab to change the CSV files from wide-form to long-form – with the corresponding code being accessible here – <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UlToXOKr9Hk2pOuY54aXdq3lncJSXG_D"> Figure 1</a>, 
            <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1edtY3Knaz5ttXl9bvePATonfOan4_Ho_#scrollTo=xo0PIogHFt6w"> Figure 2</a>, 
            <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M3pAwhaUwjTiLVIboJ3z86q2_4mF5IWh#scrollTo=5WC637lpuvsd"> Figure 3</a>, 
            <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1edB0-PpYG62vLMbtlq0AlsQZi2ykeFzP#scrollTo=R5VPxF4lSHAS"> Figure 5</a>.
            Excel was also used to manually remove datapoints that were unnecessary such as datapoints for ‘World’ and ‘High-income Countries’. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue occurred for the World Map with the country names in the JSON file not matching those found in the World Bank CSV file- however this was fixed by manually adjusting the CSV file in excel. 
            For Figure 5, initially the chart had an issue with reading a CSV file. The chart only began to function once I converted the data into a JSON string using Google Colab, with the code accessible <a class="textLink" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_DL1Ucw-NxtVgd6zuYkArkfKSs9GaoxU#scrollTo=0Qcic0Ht1QrF">here</a>. 
            The reason for this is that the JSON data format distinguishes between string and numerical data while the CSV data format expresses all entries as strings which Vega couldn’t interpret.
        </p>

        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            From the first figure alone, it is clear that every continent has experienced a fertility rate decline over the past 60 years with Africa remaining as the continent with the highest fertility rates. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The subsequent charts illustrate some of the trends that explain the decline in Fertility Rates, but what was interesting to see is that Europe seems unaffected by a lot of these trends in a way that Asia and Africa are not. 
            This is likely due to Europe’s relative development compared to Asia and Africa, in that they have borne the brunt of much of these factors, while Asia and Africa are behind and are experiencing these effects on their fertility rates.   
            This idea is seen in delays to marriage and increasing female education where there is a split in the negative correlation between these factors on fertility rates for Africa and Asia, while Europe seems unaffected.
        </p>
        
        <p>
             Another point to be made is that though increasing female labour force participation is an often-cited reason as to why fertility rates are declining, Figure 5 doesn’t provide clear evidence supporting this argument. Hovering over Asian and African countries will show a mix of responses, all of which experiencing fertility decline, with some countries having increasing female labour force participation, while others stagnant or declining.
